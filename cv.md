## Briefly About Myself:

I started studying Frontend development quite recently. A couple of months ago I moved to another country. This gave me the opportunity to understand what field I want to work in.

Of the entire range of IT specialties, Frontend Development attracts me the most. This profession provides unlimited opportunities for professional growth. There is a lot of educational material in this direction, in the form of lectures, books and training courses.

I hope that systematic work and hard work will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
